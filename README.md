# Useful linux scripts and programs


### Smart screen rotation
Rotates screen but doesn't invert cursor movements. Useful for laptops with 180 and 360 degree hinge. 

###### Requirements
* xrandr
* xinput

Just assign the keyboard shortcut for the [script](../master/rotate-screen-180/rotate-screen.sh) in your window manager


### Firefox smooth scrolling
Firefox scrolling isn't really smooth with touchpads on X. These settings will make it a little bit better

[install](../master/firefox-smooth-scrolling/install.sh)
**WARNING!** the installer may replace your existing firefox settings
